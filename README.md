Gloves Off? Evaluating the Impact of UFCâ€™s Short-Lived Glove Redesign on Fight Outcomes
Overview

This repository contains the data and analysis for our study on the UFCâ€™s short-lived glove redesign in 2024. The gloves were introduced to reduce eye pokes and hand injuries, but early commentary suggested they may have also changed fight dynamics.
Our analysis asks: Did the glove redesign measurably affect knockout rates and other fight outcomes?

Methods

Data source: Official UFC fight statistics.

Study design: We examined three six-month windows:

W1: Six months before the glove change

W2: During the glove window

W3: Six months after (capped at UFC Fight Night: Sandhagen vs. Figueiredo)

Metrics analyzed: KO finishes, knockdowns, significant/total strikes, takedowns, submissions, and control time.

Statistical tests: Two-sample tests for proportions and means, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values.

Results
Knockout Finishes

KO rate:

W1 = 33.1% (n=248)

W2 = 22.2% (n=239)

W3 = 34.8% (n=224)

Comparisons:

W2 vs W1: âˆ’10.9 points (95% CI âˆ’18.8 to âˆ’3.0, p = 0.007)

W2 vs W3: âˆ’12.7 points (95% CI âˆ’20.8 to âˆ’4.5, p = 0.0025)
ðŸ‘‰ KO rates dipped significantly during W2.

Knockdowns

W1 = 0.407 per fight

W2 = 0.310 per fight

W3 = 0.438 per fight

W2 vs W3 difference: âˆ’0.128 (95% CI âˆ’0.240 to âˆ’0.015, significant)

Other Metrics

Striking volume: Slightly higher in W2 (not significant).

Grappling: Takedowns, submissions, and control time largely unchanged.

Submission finish rate: Flat at ~14â€“15% across all windows.

Conclusion

The redesigned gloves were linked with fewer knockouts and knockdowns without major shifts in striking activity or grappling. This suggests even minor equipment changes can influence performance dynamics in combat sports.

For the sports industry, these results underscore the need to empirically evaluate equipment changes to balance athlete safety, competitive fairness, and fan experience.
